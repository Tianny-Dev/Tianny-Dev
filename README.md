# 👋 Hi, I'm Ahllaine

💡 **Full-Stack Web Developer** specializing in building scalable, user-focused web applications using **Laravel**, **Spring Boot**,  **React**, and **Vue.js**.

I build systems — not just features.

With hands-on experience in real-world deployments, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and designing backend architectures that scale. I care about performance, structure, and long-term maintainability.

## 💡 Developer Philosophy
> “Hindi ko alam paano ko gagawin, pero magagawa ko.”
> 
> *“I may not know exactly how I’ll do it — but I know I can get it done.”*

I believe every complex problem can be broken down, understood,
and solved through persistence, structured thinking, and continuous learning.

I don’t get intimidated by unfamiliar systems — I study them,
break them apart, and build solutions that work.
